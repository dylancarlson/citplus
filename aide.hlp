  2Helpfile: MXhf1X0
 
 The Citadel system contains a large collection of features, many of which
are quite complex.  The following describes how aide commands act upon
messages, rooms, groups, and halls.  In addition a few miscellaneous
commands are described.
 
 
                            2--- Messages ---0
 
 3bMarking messages0
     Messages can be marked by pressing the 3M0 key while the message is
     being printed out. The message will be printed again, and you will be
     asked to confirm your choice.
 
     Messages marked in this way may then be inserted into any room on the
     system with the .Aide Insert message (.AI) command. This also is used
     with 3Problem user messages0 and 3Moderated messages0.
 
 3bProblem user messages0
     Messages from problem users are only visible to aides.  Such messages
     have the message "[problem user]" prominently in the header. Aides will
     be prompted "Release? (Y/N)[N]:" after each Problem user message.  If a
     message is released, all users will be able to see it.  A released
     message will display "[viewable problem user]" in the header, and can be
     un-released by marking the message.
 
 3bModerated messages0
     Messages posted in moderated rooms will not be viewable to regular users
     until someone with Aide access releases them.  The message will display
     "[moderated]" in the header, and the aide will be prompted "Release
     (Y/N)[N]:" after the message header.  When a message is released, all
     users can see it. A released message can be un-released by marking it.
 
 3bNetworked messages0
     Messages received from the network can be manipulated in the same
     manner as any other message.  Any message posted in a networked room by
     any user with Network access will be sent over the network.  If a user
     without Network access posts in a networked room, the message will be
     tagged as a 3Moderated message0 and delt with like any other such
     message. If the message is released, it will be sent out on the network;
     if not, it will only be visible on the local system.
 
 3bDeleting messages0
     To kill messages, press the 3K0 key while the message is begin printed
     out.  The message will then be printed again, and you will be asked to
     confirm your choice. Deleted messages are noted in the Aide) room, so
     they can be retrieved if they need to be put back.
 
 3b.Aide Insert message (.AI) command0
     This command inserts the most recently marked or deleted message in the
     current room.  The message is the same message as the old one.  It has
     the name of the room it came from added to the header.
 
 3b.Aide Name messages (.AN) command0
     This allows aides to change the message nym from "message" or whatever
     it may be.  The sysop can lock this, however.
 
                              2--- Rooms ---0
 
 Rooms can be created by any user (subject to sysop policy).  The sysop
can optionally choose to restrict room creation only to Aides, or allow
regular users to create rooms only in certain halls.
 
 3b.Aide Edit room (.AE) command0
     This command can modify the attributes of a room, the things that can be
     modified include:
 
          3B0 By Invitiation Only (BIO)

          3D0 Room's upload/download directory

          3W0 Room's Network ID
          3Y0 Anonymous room
 
     To use some of these options, you must be a Sysop as well as an Aide.
 
     Use 3S0ave Changes, and answer yes to make the changes permanent. If
     you answer No, Citadel will return to the edit prompt. You may then make
     more changes, or use 3A0bort Changes to abort any changes you have made.
 
 3b.Aide Kill room (.AK) command0

     that group.
 
 
                              2--- Files ---0
