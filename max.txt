US/WA/WHATCOM, (206)PRI-VATE
brent:	just an aesthetic bug:	if the 'initializing modem' window appears 
while the 'exit citadel query' window is open, the 'initializing modem' window 
will not close until a key is pressed (and sometimes one can press many keys 
while the 'exit query' is still open, and citadel will respond to them as if 
the window were closed)

---------
 Also: is there a way to keep citadel from trying to reset the port constantly?
So I can say, "switch to the designated empty com port" with a keystroke, run 
AOL, copy and paste back to Citadel.  With Citadel constantly accessing the 
port, I have to close Cit, get my text, save it, then wait until I'm through 
with my AOL or other online session, then do my message entry to Cit.

 Brent: before you'd said you didn't understand what the keyword #ANSWER would 
accomplish. 
 Instead of having a complex initialization string, Citadel should be able to 
have keywords to define common things that people put in their initialization 
strings.  For instance, we usually have answer rings set to 255, so that 
Citadel will never answer the phone (it is anyways, but it's probably not Cit's
fault).  Some people turn off compression.	I think you get the idea.  Make 
keywords in config.cit that ADD to the initialization string when initializing 
the port, so that for most common tasks, new sysops don't have to translate AT 
commands.

	94Apr07 11:38:54 From Captain James T Kirk @ Starfleet Academy, Olympia 
{used to be goodbye blue sky,}, Thurston, WA {but not anymore...}, USA, 
(206)491-9605
suggestion:  

 the ability to tag a bunch of rooms and then either kill them all, or move 
them...   

 suggestion III: 

 the ability to set something in INPUT.APL which would make gremcit do a NEt6_9
incorporation after it finished the current event.	 
 so i could have Gremcit shell out and run my Keyserver, and it would stick 
something in INPUT.APL which caused gremcit to incorportate it's NET6_9 packet.
currently i have to use 2 different events...so the incorporation can be hours 
after keyserve was run... 

 suggestion IV: 

 AVATAR support...	or, even better, completely configurable emulation...  just
another .CIT file with an entry for each emulation you want to support.  
 ie. 

 #EMM_NAME "AVATAR" 
 #RED "[avatar code for red goes here]" 
 #GREEN "[etc...]" 

 since citadel doesn't make any use of any of the cursor positioning commands, 
this would be really easy to set up... 

 suggestion VI: 

 the ability to re-direct netmail addressed to a certain account to a file...  
(in citadel message format...)...  so i could have an account called "Keyserve"
on SFA here.  then people could just mail "Keyserve @ Starfleet Academy" to get
to the keyserver... 

 suggestion VIII: 

 Show free XMS on the status screen.  currently it shows free comventional ram,
and used XMS...a little strange, no? 

 suggestion IX: 

 Show the number of new messages after the "Networked with [nodename]" string 
on the status screen...  the old DragCit status screen had this... 

 suggestion XI: 

 Improve the loging of sysop commands to the Trap file...  currently, when 
someone edits someone elses account and changes the username, only the new 
username gets saved to the trapfile.  so how is one suposed to know what the 
account used to be called? 

 and generally just write more to the trap file. 

 suggestion XII: 

 multiple user sigs...	just save um to the Log extention files... 

 suggestion XIII: 

 give us a way to read the * field...  list it in the verbose header or 
something...  granted, it's not currently used, but it would be kinda nice to 
see what was in it when it does get used.
