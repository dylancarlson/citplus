 File queuing capabilities are accessed through the .Q... command menu.  The

queuing, if any at all.  This command will not be active if the Sysop has
disabled file queuing.
 
                    3g--- Adding files to your queue ---0
 
 Use the .Queue Add (3.QA0) command to add files into your download queue. In

see a list of the files in a given room, use the .Read Directory (3.RD0) or
.Read Infofile (3.RI0) command.
 
                  3g--- Removing files from your queue ---0
 
 Use the .Queue Remove file (3.QR0) command to remove files from your queue.
Note that you may 3bNOT0 use wildcards when specifying files to be removed.
You may only remove files individually.  You may identify files by either their
full name, or file number.
