                          3g--- Configuring ---0
 
 3b.Read Configuration (.RC) command0
     This command displays your current configuration.
 
 3b.Enter Configuration (.EC) command0
     This command lets you change your configuration. When you invoke it,
     you are presented with a menu containing the following choices:
 
     3R0 Room descriptions
         Room descriptions are files that the sysop can attach to a room to
         give some explanation of the room. If this option is turned on, then
         Citadel displays this file to you the first time you enter a room
         during a call. If this option is turned off, then Citadel does not
         display the contents of this file.
 
     3-0 Hall descriptions
         Hall descriptions are files that the sysop can attach to a hall to
         give some explanation of the hall. If this option is turned on, then
         Citadel displays this file to you every time you enter a hall during
         a call. If this option is turned off, then Citadel does not display
         the contents of this file.
 
     3+0 Room info lines
         Room info lines are brief (80 characters or fewer) descriptions of
         rooms, which may be created when a room is created or changed later
         by an Aide. If this option is turned on, then Citadel displays this
         line to you every time you enter a room. If this option is turned
         off, then Citadel does not display the line.
 
     310 Wide rooms
         When you do a Known rooms (3K0) command, Citadel displays the rooms in
         one of two methods, depending on the setting of this option. If this
         option is turned on, then the room list is displayed in two columns,
         making it easy to see which rooms are being listed. If this option
         is turned off, then Citadel displays as many rooms as it can per
         line, separating each room with a comma, fitting the maximum number
         of rooms per line.
 
     3X0 Auto next hall
         When this is turned on, Citadel automatically takes you to the next
         hall on the system when you enter a window room. This usually works
         well to take you through the system without every having to manually
         change halls, but it does not work as well if the sysop has created
         an elaborate hall and window scheme.
 
     3V0 Auto verbose
         Usually, to get more information when reading messages, the Verbose
         (3V0) modifier is used in the .Read Messages (3.RM0) command. This
         setting is useful for people who always want the full message header,
         by forcing verbose mode to always be on. This also affects a few
         other commands that have a Verbose mode.
 
     3L0 Verbose logout
         This option turns on verbose mode for only the .Terminate (3.T0)
         command. This is useful for people who always want full log-out
         information (such as time on the system, number of messages read
         and entered, etc.), but do not want to see everything verbosely.
         This option is not present when Auto verbose (3V0) is enabled, as it
         would be redundant: this is a subset of that option.
 
     3U0 List in userlog
         Turning this setting on makes it so that other users cannot see your
         entry in the userlog, and therefore cannot know when you last called,
         or that you even called at all. This does not, however, prevent Aides
         from being able to see your entry.
 
     3H0 Helpful hints
         Helpful hints give you more information about what Citadel is doing,
         or expects from you. After a while, these notes become more annoying
         than helpful. When this happens, turn them off with this option.
 
     3Y0 You are here
         For users new to room systems, turning this on may help navagating
         the system. When this is on, it presents a list of accessible halls
         and rooms before every room prompt.
 
     3M0 Minibin stats
         When logging on to a Citadel, it usually gives you information 
         regarding what has happened since your last call: the number of
         callers the system has had since then, the number of messages they
         left on the system, etc. If you do not want to see this information,
         turn it off with this option.
 
     3#0 # of users on login
         Citadel can give you a listing when you login of what users were the
         most recent callers to the system.  Use this option to set how many
         users to list.
 
     3I0 Titles/surnames
         Citadel gives users the ability to add text both before their names
         (titles) and after (surnames). They may be informative, humorous,
         bizarre, or whatever else the user wants. If you find them all
         to be just annoying, use this option to supress the display of them.
 
     3,0 Show commas in numbers
         By default, Citadel displays numbers over 999 with the proper comma
         punctuation.  If you would rather see numbers without the commas, turn
         this option off.
 
     3>0 Default hall
         Usually, Citadel logs all users into whatever hall the Sysop has
         specified as the system default. Some users wish to start in another
         hall, which may contain the rooms they read most. This can be
         accomplished by setting the default hall to whatever is desired.
 
     3P0 Default protocol
         Usually, Citadel waits for the user to supply a file transfer
         protocol when the Upload (3U0) and Download (3D0) commands are used.
         If a defualt protocol is specified, Citadel uses that instead. The
         default protocol can be overridden by using the .Upload (3.U0) and
         .Download (3.D0) commands, which always wait for a protocol.
 
     330 Title
         A user's title is prepended to the user's name in messages, and other
         locations.  Use this to set a title for yourself, if you wish.  It is
         a good idea to turn on viewing of titles and surnames (3I0) for this.
 
     340 Surname
         A surname is appended to the user's name in messages, and other
         locations.  Use this to set a surname for yourself, if you wish.  It
         is a good idea to turn on viewing of titles and surnames (3I0) for
         this.
 
     3_0 Signature
         Messages can have two signatures: one for the board and one for the
         user. The board's signature is defined by the sysop. This is used to
         define the user signature you wish to have appended to your messages.
 
     3F0 Forwarding to
         You can choose to have exclusive messages sent to you to be forwarded
         to another user. This other user can be someone on the board, or
         someone on another board on the network. Just enter the user's name
         and Citadel will start forwarding any new messages. By choosing this
         option and selecting no name, you can turn off forwarding if it is
         currently on.
 
     3&0 Address
         If you have a hard-to-type name, you may want to set an address for
         your account. Then, other users just have to enter your address to
         send mail to you. (For example, a user with the name John Quilcene
         Jackovichsky, Jr. might use his initials: JQJ.)
 
     3T0 Terminal settings
         This option brings up another menu, with the following choices:
 
         3W0 Screen width
             This tells Citadel how wide your terminal screen is, which it
             uses to properly word wrap output. Most terminals support 80
             columns today. Valid values range from 10 to 255 columns.
 
         3U0 Uppercase only
             This tells Citadel to send all text out mapped to uppercase
             letters only. This is useful for users with older terminals which
             cannot handle lowercase letters.
 
         3F0 Linefeeds
             This tells Citadel to send a linefeed (ASCII 10) after every
             carriage return (ASCII 13) that it sends. This is required for
             most terminals, but double spaces the text on others.
 
         3T0 Tabs
             This tells Citadel to send tabs characters out. If this is turned
             off, Citadel sends enough spaces to simulate eight-space tab
             stops. On terminals that support tabs, message reading is
             slightly faster when this option is turned on.
 
         3N0 Nulls
             This tells Citadel to send out nulls as filler between sending
             a carriage return and linefeed (if so configured) to the user.
             This is useful on slower terminals, which might not be able to
             keep up with the baud of the connection. If you cannot see the
             first characters of each line, set this to the number of missing
             characters.
 
         3O0 IBM room prompts
             In order to enable this setting, your Terminal Type (as described
             later) must support IBM graphics characters.  Enabling this
             replaces the normal room prompt terminators with extended IBM
             characters.
 
         3I0 Twirly cursor
             When Citadel is waiting for user input, it can display a twirly
             cursor, to let you know that it is waiting. Note that the cursor
             pattern is under the sysop's control, so it might not actually
             twirl.
 
         3M0 Music
             This tells Citadel that your terminal supports music codes. Most
             terminals do not, but users of those that do might want to
             enable this, in case the sysop has put such codes into the board.
 
         3L0 Lines per screen
             This sets the number of lines after which Citadel should pause
             the display. This screen pause can also be turned off with this
             option.
 
         3>0 More prompt
             Set this to whatever you want Citadel to display after a full
             screen of text, while waiting for a keypress.  The default for
             Citadel is "<More>".
 
         3T0 Terminal type
             This tells Citadel what kind terminal emulation your computer will
             support and properly display.  There are at least two different
             types that support ANSI: ANSI Color and ANSI Mono.  For full ANSI
             information, refer to the help file 3cANSI0.
 
         3R0 Attributes
             This prompts for color numbers to send in response to the ^A0
             through ^A4 codes. This is only available if you are configured
             to use ANSI. You will be prompted for each color number; enter
             either the number or press the 3?0 key to view the 3cCOLORS0 chart
             which shows what each color number appears as.
 
         3B0 Back to previous menu
             This returns you to the main menu.
 
     350 Format strings
         This option brings up another menu, with the following choices:
 
         3P0 Prompt format
             This lets the user change what the room prompt looks like. It is
             possible, for example, to have Citadel give the current time as
             part of the prompt, or the group the current room belongs to, or
             many other pieces of information. For a full explanation of what
             is allowed for a prompt format, see the file 3cPROMPT0, which
             is available when setting the prompt by pressing the 3?0 key.
 
         3T0 Time/date stamp
             This lets the user change what the time stamp looks like. It is
             possible, for example, to have Citadel give the day of the week in
             numeric form (300 being Sunday, 310 being Monday, etc.), in
             short form (3Sun0, 3Mon0, etc.), or on long form (3Sunday0, 3Monday0,
             etc.). There are two format strings used: regular and verbose.
             When reading messages with Verbose turned on, and most other times
             that Citadel gives a time, the verbose format string is used.
             When reading messages without Verbose turned on, the regular
             format string is used. For a full explanation of what is allowed
             for the timestamp format, see the file 3cTIME0, which is
             available while setting the stamp by pressing the 3?0 key.
 
         3N0 Net prefix
             When listing rooms, Citadel prepends the net prefix to the room
             name to let you know that it is a networked room. Additionally,
             the default room prompt (which can be changed by the sysop, or
             by each user individually with the Prompt format (3P0) option,
             described later in this list) displays the net prefix before
             networked rooms.
 
         3B0 Back to previous menu
             This returns you to the main menu.
 
     360 Personal information
         This option brings up another menu, with the following choices:
 
         3R0 Real name
             This lets you enter your real name. Real names are never
             displayed to any users other than sysops on a Citadel. However,
             they are written to networked messages. If a room is networked
             into some other network that requires real names, they may be
             displayed on the other network.
 
         3P0 Phone number
             This lets you enter or change your phone number. Phone numbers
             are never displayed to any users other than sysops, and never
             leave the board in networked messages.
 
         310 Address line 1
         320 Address line 2
         330 Address line 3
             These let you set your street mailing address. Your mailing
             address is never displayed to any users other than sysops, and
             never leaves the board in networked messages.
 
         3B0 Back to previous menu
             This returns you to the main menu.
 
     3R0 Message Read options
         This option brings up another menu, with the following choices:
 
         3*0 View censored messages
             Censored messages are messages that contain text that the Sysop
             has deemed inappropraite or offensive to some users.  Normally
             Citadel will not display censored messages to you, but you can
             enable viewing of them with this option.
 
         3C0 CLS before msg
             Usually, Citadel displays messages one after the other when the
             user is reading them. Some users, however, prefer to have each
             message start fresh at the top of a blank screen. Turn this option
             on to have Citadel do this. This is only available if the user has
             ANSI terminal emulation turned on. (See Terminal settings (3T0),
             later in this list.) Note: It is highly reccommended that you also
             turn Pause after msg (3@0) on if you choose to use this feature.
 
         3@0 Pause after msg
             Citadel usually displays all messages to the user with no pausing,
             leaving it up to the user to determine when to pause the output.
             However, some users find it easier to have Citadel pause after
             every message it displays. Turning this option on makes it do
             that.
 
         3J0 Subjects
             Messages may have subjects, telling what the message is about.
             However, some users find these to be redundant; the subject can
             be known by reading the message. Turning this option off keeps
             Citadel from displaying message subjects.
 
         3G0 Signatures
             Signatures are attached to the bottom of messages, and usually
             have no relevance to the message and are quite repetetive, and
             thus often are thought of as annoying. Use this option to supress
             the display of signatures.
 
         3L0 Last old on new
             It is often easier to keep track of the discussion in a room
             between calls by viewing the last old message when you read the
             new messages in a room. Turning this feature on gives you this
             reminder.
 
         3A0 Author-based exclusions
             This option brings up another menu, with the following choices:
 
             3L0 List
                 This lists your current author-based message exclusions.
                 Citadel will not display any message from an author that you
                 have excluded.
 
             3A0 Add
                 This adds another author-based message exclusion.
 
             3R0 Remove
                 This removes a author-based message exclusion.
 
             3B0 Back to previous menu
                 This returns you to the Message Read options menu.
 
         3N0 Node-based exclusions
             This option brings up another menu, with the following choices:
 
             3L0 List
                 This lists your current node-based message exclusions.
                 Citadel will not display any message from a node that you
                 have excluded.
 
             3A0 Add
                 This adds another node-based message exclusion.
 
             3R0 Remove
                 This removes a node-based message exclusion.
 
             3B0 Back to previous menu
                 This returns you to the Message Read options menu.
 
         3T0 Text-based exclusions
             This option brings up another menu, with the following choices:
 
             3L0 List
                 This lists your current text-based message exclusions.
                 Citadel will not display any message containing text that
                 you have excluded.
 
             3A0 Add
                 This adds another text-based message exclusion.
 
             3R0 Remove
                 This removes a text-based message exclusion.
 
             3B0 Back to previous menu
                 This returns you to the Message Read options menu.
 
         3R0 Region-based exclusions
             This option brings up another menu, with the following choices:
 
             3L0 List
                 This lists your current region-based message exclusions.
                 Citadel will not display any message from a region that you
                 have excluded.
 
             3A0 Add
                 This adds another region-based message exclusion.
 
             3R0 Remove
                 This removes a region-based message exclusion.
 
             3B0 Back to previous menu
                 This returns you to the Message Read options menu.
  
         3E0 Exclude encrypted
             Encrypted messages are messages coded with a keyword by the user.
             Sysops can control whether or not to allow encryption in public
             messages or just in mail.  Citadel will not display any encrypted
             messages if this is enabled.
  
         3O0 Notify on exclusion
             When Citadel excludes a message, it can either do it silently,
             or it can tell you that it is skipping the message. This option
             tells it which one to do.
  
         3M0 Message author tags
             You can tell Citadel to place extra text after a user's name in
             a message header by setting a message author tag for that user.
             You can set more than one for a user, as well. This can be used
             as a reminder about who the user is, or any other personal note
             to yourself.
 
         3B0 Back to previous menu
             This returns you to the main menu.
 
     3Z0 Pointer edit menu
         This option brings up another menu, with the following choices:
 
         3S0 Set all pointers
             This sets all message pointers in all rooms to a specified value.
             This can be beneficial after returning to a board that you have
             not called for a few months; you can set the pointer back by a
             few hundred, so you only have that many new messages to read, not
             a few thousand.
 
         3N0 Set all pointers to new
             This sets all message pointers in all rooms to make all messages
             on the system new.
 
         3O0 Set all pointers to old
             This sets all message pointers in all rooms to make all messages
             on the system old.
 
         3R0 Set pointer for a room
             This sets the message pointer for a specific room to a specified
             message. This is useful if you only read some of the messages
             in a room. You can set the message pointer to the last message
             you read, then bypass the room. On the next call to the system,
             only messages newer than the last one you read will be new.
 
         3D0 Display all pointers
             This shows the message pointer for every room on the system that
             you have access to.
 
         3B0 Back to previous menu
             This returns you to the main menu.
 
     3E0 Message Editor options
         This option brings up another menu, with the following choices:
 
         3V0 Verbose continue
             When using the Continue (3C0) command of the message editor,
             Citadel can either display the whole message to you as it has
             been entered up to that point, or just the last 100 bytes.
             Turning this on tells Citadel to display the full message, and
             leaving it off tells it to only display the last 100 bytes.
 
         3S0 Confirm Save
             This tells Citadel to confirm your choice to save a message when
             in the message editor.
 
         3A0 Confirm Abort
             This tells Citadel to confirm your choice to abort a message when
             in the message editor.
 
         3E0 Confirm not .EO
             This tells Citadel to confirm the loss of aborted messages by
             not using the .Enter Old Message (3.EOM0) command when entering a
             message after aborting the last one.
 
         3U0 Bunny filter
             This tells Citadel to apply the Bunny filter to your messages. The
             Bunny filter will attempt to correctly capitalize messages posted
             in all uppercase.
 
         3P0 Spell-checker options
             This option brings up another menu, with the following choices:
  
             3P0 Spell checker mode
                 This configures Citadel's spell checker for your preference:
                 Automatic, Verbose, Regular, or Terse modes. See the help file
                 3cSPELL0 for full information on Citadel's spell checker.
 
             3S0 Check apostraphe S
                 This tells the spell checker whether or not to include the
                 "3's0" at the end of a word when it checks for correct
                 spelling.
 
             3C0 Check all-caps
                 This tells the spell checker whether or not to check words
                 entered in all uppercase for correct spelling.
 
             3D0 Check digits
                 This tells the spell checker whether or not to check words
                 that contain numbers for correct spelling.
 
             3A0 Add word to dictionary
                 This adds a word to your personal dictionary used by the spell
                 checker. See the help file 3cSPELL0 for full information on
                 Citadel's spell checker.

             3L0 List words in dictionary
                 This lists the words in your personal dictionary used by the
                 spell checker. See the help file 3cSPELL0 for full
                 information on Citadel's spell checker.
 
             3B0 Back to previous menu
                 This returns you to the Message Editor options menu.
 
         3R0 Text replacement options
             This option brings up another menu, with the following choices:
 
             3L0 List
                 Citadel has the ability to automatically replace words during
                 message entry with other words.  This option will list what
                 words are currently being replaced, and with what. See the help
                 file 3cSPELL0 for full information on Citadel's spell checker.
             
             3A0 Add
                 This adds a word that you would like to be automatically
                 replaced with another during message entry. See the help file

                 This returns you to the Message Editor options menu.

             This returns you to the main menu.

         This asks for confirmation, then (if you confirm your choice) saves
         your configuration as you have specified it.
 
     3A0 Abort
         This asks for confirmation, then (if you confirm your choice) aborts
         any configuration changes you have made.

     This command lets you enter new initials and password. Each of these can
     be up to 30 characters long and contain any printable chararacters. Case
     is not considered significant, so the passwords "WOW" and "wow" are
     considered to be the same by Citadel.
