  2HELP0
 
 This file gives the basics of Citadel's command structure.  If you are new
to Citadels in general, read the 2MXhf10X0 help file first; this
introduces the concepts of rooms and halls, which is essential for the full
understanding of of Citadel.
 
 Citadel's command structure is designed around two principles: be highly
consistent, and give quick access to common commands.
 
 Quick access to common commands is achieved by having them be a single key.
For example, one of the most commonly used commands shows all new messages
in the current room; the command is New Messages and is accessed by simply
pressing the "3N0" key.
 
 All multiple-key commands start with a period, which tells Citadel to
expect more keystrokes, then the key for the command, followed by more keys
that specify more information about the command to execute.  Actually, though
a period is displayed on the screen and is used in menus, it is easiest to use
the space bar; Citadel treats this the same, as it does with the comma and
slash keys.  You just need to send some part of your hand down to that area of
the keyboard and press something.  This brings up another point: Citadel often
allows you to do something in more than one way. This lets you choose the one
that is easiest for you to remember.
 
 To be highly consistent, command keys in many commands do the same thing.
For example, the "3V0" key almost always invokes a verbose version of the
command, the "3R0" key almost always invokes a reverse version of the
command, etc.  Also, multiple-key commands are usually related to single-key
commands. For example, the single-key "3E0" command is the Enter Message
command.  Multiple-key commands starting with "3.E0" are all forms of the
.Enter command. (Such as "3.EC0" to use the .Enter Configuration command,
which lets you change your current user configuration.)
 
 The common (single-key) commands are:
 
 "3E0" -- Enter Message.  This lets you enter a message.
 "3G0" -- Goto.  This goes to the next room with new messages in the current
            hall.
 "3M0" -- Mail.  This lets you enter a message that can only be viewed by one
            other person (the recipeint).
 "3N0" -- New Messages.  This shows all new messages in the room.
 "3R0" -- Reverse Messages.  This shows all of the messages in the room in
            reverse order, starting with the newest.
 "3T0" -- Terminate.  This logs you off and hangs up.
 "3>0" -- Next hall.  This moves to the next hall, if you are in a window
            room.  ("3]0" also works to move to the next hall, and does not
            require the use of the shift key.)
 "3<0" -- Previous hall.  This moves to the previous hall, if you are in a
            window room.  ("3[0" also works to move to the previous hall, and
            does not require the use of the shift key.)
 
 There are more single-key commands, though they are not used as much. And
there are many multiple-key commands.  For a list of all single-key commands
use the "3?0" (Menu) command.  For a list of all multiple-key command groups,
use the "3.?0" (.Menu) command.  For a list of commands within a multiple-key
command group, start the command and press "3?0" to get a menu.  For example,
"3.R?0" will display a list of all of the .Read... commands.
