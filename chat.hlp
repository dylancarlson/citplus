 Citadel offers a simple chat system for multi-user BBSes.  There are a number
of chat commands that Citadel supports.  Some you may find more useful than
others.
 
                         2 --- Sending chats --- 0
 
   "3gC0" - This is a shortcut to certain Chat commands, so that you don't
have to type out the whole extended command.  On multi-user systems, this
defaults to Chat All.  On single-user systems, this defaults to Chat Console.
 
  "3g.C0" - A shortcut to Chat Console
 
 "3g.CA0" - (2Chat All0) Prompts for text to send as a chat to all users
currently online the system.  If you have expert mode turned on, you will get
an abbreviated single-line version of the prompt.
 
 "3g.CU0" - (2Chat User0) Use this command to send a private chat message to
another user online the system.  If you have expert mode turned on, you will
need to enter the recipient's name after the "Chat User:" prompt.  If expert
mode is off, you'll get more verbose prompting.  To get a list of what users
are currently online, use the Who All command (3W0 or 3.WA0) at the room
prompt.  Or, you can press "3?0" when prompted for the recipient user.
 
 "3g.CR0" - (2Chat Room0) This command prompts for text to send as a chat to
anyone in the room you're currently occupying.  If you have expert mode turned
on, you will get an abbreviated single-line version of the prompt.
 
 "3g.CG0" - (2Chat Group0) This command sends a chat 3bONLY0 to online users
who are a member of the specified group.  You must be in said group in order
to chat to members of it.  If you have expert mode turned on, you will need to
enter the name of the group at the "Chat Group:" prompt.  If expert mode is
off, you will get more verbose prompting.  Press "3?0" when prompted for the
group name to receive a list of groups you are a member of.
 
 "3g.CC0" - (2Chat Console0) Using this command will page the sysop of the
BBS on the console. Engaging in chat with the sysop on console is "real-time"
in that you watch each other type.  This is the only allowed form of chat on a
single-user system.
 
                         2 --- Receiving chats --- 0
 
 Citadel outputs chats the same way as other system events.  How this is
displayed to you will vary, depending on a combination of how the sysop has
configured things, and how you have set options in your System Events user
configuration menu (3.EC70).
 
 Depending on how the sysop has things set, chats normally look like this:
 
 -- 4Fred0> the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog
 
 but sometimes can look like this:
 
 -- 3From 4Fred03 to all:0 the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog
 
 The following chat-related options are toggleable through the System Events
submenu (3.EC70).  See the help file 3cMXhf3X0 for more information on
setting your account configuration:
