 3gWelcome to Citadel!0
 
 If you've never called a room based bulletin board before, you might have a
little learning to do to make full use of the features available on this
board.  This text will attempt to help you find your way around this type of
software.
 
 First of all, it is highly recommended to use ANSI terminal emulation if you
can.  It makes reading the messages easier.  Turn it on by first using the 
.Enter Configuration (3.EC0) command, then choosing the Terminal settings (3T0)
subcommand, then choosing Terminal type (3T0).  Choose a terminal emulation
mode that your system supports. ANSI Color is recommended if you have a color
monitor.  Then press 3B0 to get back to the main .Enter Configuration menu,
and press 3S0 to save you changes and return to the room prompt.
 
 Messages forming conversations are held in "3grooms0".  Rooms are usually
grouped  together into "3ghalls0".  Users wander from room to room, reading
new messages in the rooms that interest them and entering their own messages,
extending the conversation.  Citadel's format tends to focus users of the
system on the messages, though file transfers are available.
 
 First and foremost: Nearly any time while text is being displayed, you can
press certain keys to perform specific actions.  Citadel is not case sensitive,
so you can enter commands in either uppercase or lowercase; it does not
matter.  The most used of these keys are:
 
 3S0 to 3g<S>top0 the output.
 
 3N0 to skip to the 3g<N>ext0 message.
 
 3P0 to 3g<P>ause0 the output.  While text is paused, you can press 3S0 or 3N0 to
    3g<S>top0 the messages or skip to the 3g<N>ext0 message.  Almost any other key
    will restart the output.
 
 There are many commands that may be used to travel from room to room.  These,
like most commands, are entered at the "3groom prompt0".  Room prompts usually
look something like this:
 
    2City Hall>>0       or
    2Post Office>0      or
    2Other BBSes]0      or
    2Words Upon Words:0 or
    2Secret Place)0     etc.
 
 The common commands to move from room to room are:
 
 3G0 to 3g<G>oto0 the next room containing new messages since your last call.
 
 3J0 to 3g<J>umpback0 to the room you were in just before you hit <G>oto.
 
 3+0 to go to the next room in the hall.
 
 3-0 to go to the previous room in the hall.
 
 3.G0 to go to a specific room by name.  After entering 3.G0, type the name (or a
    portion of the name) of the room you want to go to.  The board will find it
    for you if it is in the current the hall and take you to it.
 
 Once you have read all of the messages in all of the rooms in a hall, you
would generally want to move to the next hall.  To do this, use one of the
following two commands:
 
 3>0 to go to the next hall.
 
 3<0 to go to the previous hall.
 
 These commands may only be used from window rooms.  Window rooms are special
rooms that allow access to different halls.  You can tell which rooms are
window rooms by looking at the symbols in the room prompt that are after the
room name.  If there are two ">" characters, or some other character (such as
":" or "]") followed by a ">" character, then you are in a window room.
 
 To read the messages left in a room, the common commands to use are:
 
  3N0 to read the 3g<N>ew0 messages since your last visit to this room.
 
  3R0 to read the messages in this room in 3g<R>everse0 order, from newest to
    oldest.  Remember that a room may have many messages, so you'll probably
    want to use the 3g<S>top0 command mentioned earlier before Citadel is done
    listing the messages.
 
  3F0 to read the messages in this room in 3g<F>orward0 order, from oldest to
    newest.  As with the 3g<R>everse0 command, you may want to 3g<S>top0 the output
    early when using this command.

  3O0 to read the 3g<O>ld0 messages in this room in reverse order.
 
  There are a couple of ways to enter messages, either public or private:
 
  3E0 will 3g<E>nter0 a message in the room for everyone to see.
 
  3.EE0 will enter an exclusive (private) message to a specific user.  You will
      be asked who to send a message to.  Type the other user's name, or a
      portion of it.  Citadel will give you the full name of the user you are
      sending the message to when entering it.  If you entered a partial user
      name, it is a good idea to check this to make sure that Citadel did not
      find another user with a similar name.
 
  While entering messages, to put a blank line in your message, you must type
a <SPACE> then a <RETURN> or <ENTER>.  Hitting <RETURN> or <ENTER> on a blank
line brings you to Citadel's message editor prompt.  This lets you perform a
number of edits, including these often used commands:
 
  3S0 will 3g<S>ave0 your message as it is.
 
  3P0 will 3g<P>rint0 your message back to you so you can see what it will look
    like.
 
  3R0 will 3g<R>eplace0 a word or series of words with another word or series of
    words.
 
  3A0 will 3g<A>bort0 the message.
 
  3V0 will 3g<V>erify0 the spelling of the message.
 
 Remember that each message is formatted for each caller's screen width when
displayed, so be careful with your formatting.  If you want to enter a table
or other columnized list, be sure to start every line with a space.  Citadel
will then know that it should not combine that line with the last.
 
 Earlier, when giving examples of possible room prompts, you might have
noticed that they had different symbols after the names.  These symbols tell
you what type of room it is.  Normal rooms end with a single 3>0 character.
Other rooms have other characters.  Not all types of rooms have special symbols
attached to them, however; these end with the normal 3>0 character.  The types of
rooms are:
 
  3gDirectory0 rooms.  These end with a 3]0 symbol, and allow files to be
uploaded and downloaded.  Type 3.RD0 to view the files available, or 3.RI0 to
view an info file, which includes a brief description of the files.  For more
information on file transfers, refer to the help file 3cFILES0.
 
  3gApplication0 rooms.  These allow access to games and questionnaires.  Use
3.EA0 to access applications.  For more information on applications, refer to the
help file 3cDOORS0.
 
  3gHidden0 rooms.  These end with a 3)0 symbol.  To get to a hidden room, you
must know its name.  Use the 3.G0 command and type the room name.  (Partial room
names are not allowed here.)
 
  3gGroup-only0 rooms.  These end with a 3:0 symbol.  To get in a group-only
room, you must be a member of the group.  Otherwise, Citadel will not let you
see it, or even know of its existence.
 
  3gWindow0 rooms.  As already mentioned, these allow you to travel from hall to
hall using the 3>0 and 3<0 commands.  Window rooms end with an extra 3>0.
 
 There are many more commands and features available for use.  To see a list
of available commands at any prompt, press the 3?0 key.  From a room prompt,
full help is available by using the 3H0 key.  You will be given instructions on
how to get more help when you use that command.
