    Download functions are available in special rooms called directory
    rooms.  Directory rooms have a "]" after the roomname, rather than
    the normal ">" character.  The following commands are used to list
    files, to download them, or to upload files:
 
                          3g--- Listing files ---0
 
 3b.RD0  -- Read Directory
 3b.RVD0 -- Read Verbose Directory (gives file size and download times)
 3b.RI0  -- Read Infofile (lists file comments)
 3b.RVI0 -- Read Verbose Infofile (lists long file info and comments)
 3b.RZ0  -- Read ZIP File
 
    The Read Directory commands list the available files in the current
    room.  This commands waits for an optional filename (possibly
    wildcarded, per UNIX filename conventions) and will restrict its
    output to those files selected.  The default is to list all of the
    files.  The info files are the same, but they include a comment on
    the file if one was entered during the upload.  The read archive
    command allows you to view the contents of a archive, such as .ZIP
    or .LZH
 
                        3g--- Downloading files ---0
                        (Receiving files from Citadel)
 
 3b.RT0  -- Read Textfile
 3bD0    -- Download 
 
    These commands download files.  Read Textfile will request a
    filename, file will be printed (as is) to you.  The Download command
    will let you choose a protocol.  Note that with batch protocols you
    can specify multiple file names to download. You can also use UNIX
    wild cards (see the wild cards section below).
 
                         3g--- Uploading files ---0
                          (Sending files to Citadel)
 
 3b.ET0  -- Enter Textfile
 3bU0    -- Upload 
 
    After supplying the filename, you will be asked to supply a brief
    comment describing the file. You have about 60 characters.  Using
    the Group-only flag will make it a hidden file.  Batch protocols
    will not prompt you for a file name, but will ask for comments after
    the transfer for each of the files. (Note: You terminate a file in
    Enter Textfile with control-Z).
 
                            3g--- Wildcards ---0
 
    Citadel supports wild cards for file names.  Wildcards work like this:
 
    * replaces any amount of characters
    ? replaces any one character
    [a-z] replaces a range of characters.
