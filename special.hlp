                        3g--- Locking Out Rooms ---0
 
  3b.EX0  -- Enter eXclude-Room
  3bX0    -- eXclude Room
 
    This room will be excluded from the default go-to rooms with unread
messages search.  You can still see the room in the Known rooms list, and
.Goto it explicitly.  To re-include a room, you must apply this command again
in the same room.
 
                        3g--- Status information ---0
 
  3b.RC0  -- Read Configuration
  3b.RS0  -- Read Status
 
    Read Configuration will display information on settings for your account
explicitly, such as terminal configuration, forwarding address, group
memberships, and default hall.  Read Status gives system-wide global
information, like the highest current message number, average message length,
how long the system has been running, and how long the current user has been
logged in.
 
                             3g--- Userlog ---0
 
  3b.RU0  -- Read Userlog
  3b.RVU0 -- Read Verbose Userlog
 
    These commands list all listed users of the system.  The verbose option
prints out the call number and the user's name, along with some other pieces
of information for Aides and Sysops.
 
                           3g--- Applications ---0
 
  3b.EA0  -- Enter Application
 
    This runs whatever application the room may have.
