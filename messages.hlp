                             3g--- General ---0
 
 While messages are being dispayed, Citadel recognises certain keystrokes that
it interprets as commands. These are:
 
 3S0 Stop
     This stops the output and returns you to the room prompt.
 
 3P0 Pause
     This pauses the output and Citadel waits for another key to resume.
 
 3N0 Next
     This skips the current message and goes on to the next one.
 
 3J0 Jump
     This skips a paragraph in the current message.
 
 3R0 Reverse
     This acts like a toggle to reverse the flow of messages. That is, if you
     are currently reading forwards, you will start reading backwards, and if
     you are currently reading backwards, you will start reading forwards.
 
 3K0 Kill
     This will ask for confirmation if you want to remove the message. If you
     answer yes, it will be removed from the room. To use this command, you
     have to either be an Aide on the board, or be reading one of your own
     messages.
 
 3M0 Mark
     This will ask for confirmation if you want to mark the message. If you
     answer yes, Citadel will mark it for later insertion with the .Aide
     Insert message (3.AI0) command. To use this command, you must be an
     Aide. For more information on manipulating messages as an Aide, refer to
     the help file 3cAIDE0.
 
 3C0 Continuous
     This will turn off screen pause and pause between messages, if they are
     currently on. Continuous mode can be turned off again by pressing 3C0
     again. However, if you are not configured for either screen pause or
     pause between messages, hitting this has no effect; this just toggles
     whether to disable them if configured for them, not whether to use them
     at all.
 
 3!0 Header scan
     This will toggle between header scan and regular mode. In header scan
     mode, Citadel only displays the headers of the messages you are reading.
 
 3V0 Verbose
     This will toggle verbose mode on and off. In verbose mode, Citadel
     displays more information in the message headers. (Such as the message
     number of the message, the path a networked message traveled to reach
     the board, etc.)
 
 3*0 Censor
     This will ask for confirmantion if you want to censor (or uncensor) the
     message currently being read. You must be an Aide to use this command.
     For more information about message censoring, refer to the help file
     3cCENSOR0.
 
 
                         3g--- Reading Messages ---0
 
 Most message reading is done with single letter commands. However, for more
control over which messages you wish to read, modifiers are provided as
extended commands. The following single letter commands may be used for
reading messages:
 
 3F0 Read Forward
     This reads all messages in the current room, from the oldest to the
     newest.
 
 3N0 Read New
     This reads all new messages in the current room, from the oldest to the
     newest. This is the most commonly used message reading command. Citadel
     can also be configured to display the last old message when reading new
     messages by using the .Enter Configuration (3.EC0) command. For more
     information on setting your configuration, refer to the help file 3cCONFIG0.
 
 3O0 Read Old
     This reads all old messages in the current room, from the newest to the
     oldest (reverse order).
 
 3R0 Read Reverse
     This reads all messages in the current room, from the newest to the
     oldest.
 
 When using message reading modifiers, start with the base .Read Messages
(3.RM0) command. Insert as many modifiers as desired between the 3R0 and the 3M0.
For example, a possible command would be .Read By user Keyword search Messages
(3.RBKM0); this would search for messages from a specified user containing
a specified word or phrase.
 
 3<number>0 Number of messages
 
 3A0 All
 
 3B0 By user
 
 3E0 Exclusive
 
 3F0 Forward
 
 3G0 Group-only
 
 3K0 or 3*0 Keyword search
 
 3L0 Local
 
 3N0 New
 
 3O0 Old
 
 3P0 Public
 
 3R0 Reverse
 
 3V0 Verbose
 
 3#0 By message number
 
 3&0 By date
 
 3!0 Header scan
 
 
                        3g--- Entering Messages ---0
 
  3bE0    -- Enter message.
  3b.EGM0 -- Enter Group-only Message.
  3b.ELM0 -- Enter Local Message.
  3bM0    -- Enter Mail (Exclusive message).
  3b.EO0  -- Enter Old message.
 
 The Enter Message command is used to create messages.  The Enter Limited
Access Message command also creates a message, but limits it to a particular
group (you are prompted for a groupname, partial names are acceptable, and you
must be a member of the group to create a message in it).  The Enter Mail
creates a private message.  Private messages can only be seen by the sender
and recipient.  Enter Old message will recover any message you aborted, if you
aborted the message the last time you entered a message during the current
session.
 
 Message entry is very simple.  You just type text (no limit on line
length, maximum message size is 8196 characters.  To end your message, press
the carriage return key twice.  This will place you in message edit mode. 
There are several commands.  The most important are:
 
  Replace String  Find & Replace  Save Buffer  Abort Message  and Continue.
 
These do the obvious things.  A "?" will get you a full list of commands.
 
 You can also upload your message using ASCII protocol as well.  Just start
the message with the (E)nter Public or (M)ail command then start your ascii
send.  Make sure you do NOT strip CR's or LF's during the transfer. (most
programs let you configure this).  If you wish to upload the message using
Xmodem/CRC or Zmodem just hit return until the message entry menu prompt is
seen and hit 'X' for X modem/CRC or Z for Zmodem then select upload from your
terminal like you would for uploading any program.  When the upload is
complete you will be returned to the message menu - just hit 'P' to list the
message to the screen to make sure it was sent right - then hit 's' to save
it.
 
 
                            3g--- Formatting ---0
 
 Messages are formatted to the callers screen width.  As much text as
possible will be collected on one line to send to the caller.  To
defeat this, start a line with a space.  This is also useful for
delineating paragraphs in your text.  Whenever you start a line with
a space, that line will always start a new line, no matter where in
the previous line the system is.  Experiment in message entry using
the Print command to see how this works.
