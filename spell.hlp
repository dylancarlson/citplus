 Citadel has a spell checker built into its internal message editor.
It is accessed by the "V" key from the "Entry command:" prompt.  It has
four modes: Automatic, Verbose, Regular, and Terse.  In Terse mode, it just
lists the words that it cannot find in its dictionary.  In Regular
mode, it lists the words that it cannot find in its dictionary, and
gives some suggestions as to the correct spelling of the words.  In
Verbose mode, it enters a dialog that lets you replace all occurances
of a misspelled word with the correct spelling, or update your
personal dictionary if the word is spelled correctly.  Automatic mode is
basically the same as Verbose mode, but will cause the spell checker to
automatically run every time you 3S0>ave a message.
 
 The current mode can be changed by the Spell Checker Mode setting of the
.Enter Configuration command. (From a room prompt, use ".EC" to invoke the
.Enter Configuration command, then "E" for Message Editor Options, and
finally "P" for the Spell Checker sub-menu.)  This menu also lets you
manipulate your personal dictionary: you can Add words to it, Remove words
from it, or List the words currently in it.
 
 Choose the mode best suited for your spelling ability; good spellers may
not want to spend the time it takes Citadel to determine possible correct
spellings for a word it cannot find in its dictionaries. Average spellers
may appreciate suggestions for correct spellings, but not want to enter in
a full session with the spell checker that a poor speller may desire.
 
 Citadel also offers a feature that will automatically replace words during
message entry.  This is especially useful for people who have a habit of
spelling certain words incorrectly the same way each time.  You can control
what words are replaced, and with what, from the Text Replacement Options
sub-menu. (From a room prompt, use ".EC" to invoke the .Enter Configuration
command, then "E" for Message Editior Options, and finally "R".)
