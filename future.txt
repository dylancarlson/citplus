 It's interesting that your book would tell you how to do the harder thing but not the easier one.

 You're sorta doing this:
 http://www.cyberport.com/~tangent/programming/winsock/advanced.html#forceif

 There are several sample programs here:
 http://www.cyberport.com/~tangent/programming/winsock/examples/basics/index.html

 It may be helpful to see this specific simple one:

if someone is in an anonymous room, then .wv reporting unknown room makes a
certain sense

creating talley buffer: done right?

networking: new message pointer set for room after room is done. new message could have been left
by other thread by then. this would cause messages to be missed on the network.

 brent, there is a bug in the timeout code.
 ti counts down, but if you hit a spot where there should be a screen pause,
the <More> prompt appears.  it keeps counting in the background.  if you hit a
key, it may or may not log you out.
 on my machine, i just hit a key, and then got "-806, Sleeping, call again"
 so the counting can go on and on....
 
 
 
 Ok, it looks like I might have found the cause of some problems.  It looks
like errorDisp() isn't threadsafe and the stripansi()   function nukes the
system. msgDisp() and trapDisp() are similar.


no force message dump (LOGIN.CPP:616: showMessages(NewOnly, FALSE, 0);)


q no quack

    01Mar13 11:20:03 From exquisite infectious tumor
    Subject: .ecrm?
suggestion:  addition of an <e>dit or <c>hange option to the .ecrm (message
tags) menu.  i've found it cumbersome to have to first remove and then recreate
message tags when i want to change them.  especially when dealing with users
with long names as the "remove" and "add" options aren't smart enough to accept
partial names.
  i was thinking something along the lines of being able to hit e or c and when
citadel asks for user, it will accept partial names and then prompt "change
user %s tag?" or something similar. and have the default for the new tag be the
old one, even, so you could simply hit ENTER and not set it to null



  1.  discrepancies in the .ec7 menu.  the "Exclusive messages" line and the
"chat to user" line.  i'm sure you can find them.

In addition to binding to 0.0.0.0, you might also consider setting the options
SO_DONTLINGER and/or SO_REUSEADDR so that, after a crash, one needn't wait for
the socket to timeout and close before restarting Citadel.

 There's also an option, SO_SNDTIMEO. I'm not sure what it's for.

 Things I want to do.
  Things I'll probably do sometime.
 Things already done.
 Things that are bad ideas.
-----------------------------------

 Speed up .FL via logtab

	 "-f#" Lets you force an event from the command line. This is great if
  you run TurboCit under a front end program such as BinkleyTerm.

	 Fixed the cron file reading funtion to take longer lines. This was
  needed to hold all the 1/2 hours possible 0-48 on one line.

	 Added a new way to configure cron event times! You may now specify
 times you "don't" want the event to run using the "!" character.
  An example:

	 #HOURS   ANY !4 !5 !6 !7

	 The above would run any 1/2 hours except 4, 5, 6, and 7.

	 Also added to CRON.CIT time entry is the "-"  character. This allows
  you to specify a range of 1/2 hours to include or exclude. An example:

	 #HOURS   0-20 !4-7 !15-18

	 The above would run during the 1/2 hours of:
	 0 1 2 3 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 19 20


 TCit now reports the time when a net callout fails.

  New config.cit keyword, #NEW_LOG_DAY, indicates the number of new accounts
  which can be created daily. Set to 0 if you don't want to use this option.
  If the maximum number of users per day is exceeded, the file newlogdy.blb 
  will be displayed and carrier will be dropped.

  Added forwarding code to incoming netmail so it gets properly forwarded 
  instead of just saved to the user. Network mail which is forwarded to another
  node will get "bounced" off the system with the name changed instead of being 
  saved to the message base.

 key to send exclusive mail to message you are reading

 Moved "List in Userlog" in configure to "L" instead of "U"
 Added signatures, borderlines, titles/surnames on/off by user in .EC
 Added user signature in .EC
 User configurable colors in .EC, code from GremCit.
 C during a text dump (message read, blurb, etc) now turns screen pause off
	until a room prompt is reached.
 E during a message read now sends mail to the author of the message.


  Added a SEQUENCE command to #LOGIN scripts... R then 3 parameters. First
  parameter is what to wait for, second is what to send if it's not recieved
  in #WAIT_TIMEOUT, third is how many times to retry.
  For example, to wait for the string "login:", sending a carriage-return
  until you get it, and trying 5 times... then sending your initials and 
  password, the following script would work:
 #LOGIN R "login:" "\r" 5 S "initials;password\r"

 Fixed Purge-Users to have an Abort option

  .Sysop Group List has been added as a synonym for .Aide List

  Added command .Sysop Purge-Users, prompts yes/no for each user in the userlog
  to kill the user- Starts at the oldest.

	 The current time of the day is now displayed at login right before the
  last time the user called. This is if logon stats are turned on.

	 Added code to prompt if a message should be generated in the room you
  copy/move a file to.

	 "-p#" Lets you specify a different COM port then what is in
  CONFIG.CIT. You might use this to allow special connection to different
  modems, or when running TurboCit under a front end program that allows
  more then one line.

	 Added "%" to the sysop menu as "Sysop Fullpath File Download". A
  remote sysop can download almost any file using this command. Any path
  is valid, but certain files are still not visible. IE: CONFIG.CIT

  Added partial name entry for groups in the hall new and rename.

	 Added a new AIDE command .AJ, .Aide Jump to aide room and maintenance
  hall. It's a mouth full, but makes it easy to jump back to the aide
  room and maintenance hall at any time. At this time it does not allow
  you to "jump" back to the room and hall you were in. That will come
  later. In the future it will toggle you between the room nad hall you
  are in and the aide and maintenance hall.

	 Added a new feature. TurboCit will now prompt a user to leave e-mail
  to the sysop if they requested chat when they were on. Before asking the
  user to leave mail, the file "CHATTED.BLB" is read to the user.

	Changed the chat bell to only ring if bells are ON.

	 Added default hall locking to the list of items that a new user can
  have defaulted on if you like.

	Cleaned up the way "hall new" and "hall rename" display and ask
 for information. These will be changed to a menu system soon.

	Added code so you can lock a single hall from users making new rooms.
 The status of this can be changed by re-naming the hall with no new
 name. TurboCit will then ask you about this as well as the other
 settings for halls.

 New CONFIG.CIT keyword, #MAX_JUMPBACK... configures the # of gotos which are
 saved for jumping back to them. Generally, setting this to about half the
 # of rooms on your system is more than adequate. Minimum of 2, for deep magic
 reasons.

 Known Rooms now no longer lists Xcluded rooms with no new messages in the
 "Rooms with no new messages" part of the list.

	Added "#AUTO_EDITOR" in EXTERNAL.CIT which allows the configuration of
 an editor that will automatically be run whenever a message is saved.
 Uses include auto word filters, bad character filters etc...

	Added the ability for users to turn off viewing of title/surnames
 on message headers. This does not override the #SURNAMES setting in
 CONFIG.CIT where you can turn off network titles/surnames. This just
 allows each user to not view titles and surnames if they can be viewed.

	 E-mail can now be entered from a shell using the input.apl and
  message.apl files. ASCII 'É' (201) is the character to use for the
  name of the user to send mail to.

 Added a new command to the #LOGIN string in NODES.CIT '@ "filename"'.
 This allows you to call another file containing more lines of login
 commands. One command per line. The file must be located in your homepath.
 The file cannot call other files with the '@' command. If the '@'
 command is used inside a file, it is ignored. You can call more then
 one file, but only one at a time.

 Example:
 <nodes.cit>
 -------------------------
 #LOGIN  @ "file.txt"
 -------------------------

 <file.txt>
 -------------------------
 p "10"
 w "hello"
 s "s"
 w "Enter your initials: "
 s "init;pass\r"
 -------------------------

 .RB should default to logged in user
 .RK should check everything else.
  Wildcard downloads now disambiguate filespecs
  * at a room prompt will bring up the bulletin menu

 ALT-F now forces the "next" event (the one the pointer is at) no
 matter what. The event is done whether it is valid, or has been done
 already.

 Added a flag in NODES.CIT to let you trap failed nets on a node by
 node basis.  The flag is "#NETFAIL" and a "0" means NO, a "1" means yes.
 If network event trapping is turned off in the CONFIG.CIT file, the
 failed nets are not trapped even if #NETFAIL = 1.

 .AQA uses GetOneKey

	Added "Default hall for new user" to the things you can toggle on for
  hall. Change by renaming an existing hall, or when creating a new
  one. Only one hall can be the default for new users. If none are
  selected, the root hall is the default.

	 Created a "super" sysop type, it's called Remote-Sysop. They can do
  all those things a normal sysop can't from remote. This includes but is
  not limited to; room applications, room directories (even locked ones),
  groups (locked and hidden), exiting the BBS (watch out for this one!).
 Turbocit Remote sysop feature

  Fixed an inconsistancy in the DOOR code which would use 0 for the port of a 
  console user, and just the number for a remote user's port... While room
  apps have LOCAL for console and COMn for remote (command line parameters)

  NOTES.CIT keyword #LOGPACE
  #LOGPACE will pause for x milliseconds (1/1000th of a second) after every
  character when processing the #LOGIN script.

  a mode that shows all input from serial port
  no. read and no. entered and uploaded stored in log

/*************************************************************************/


	Fixed upload count credit for batch uploads if the balance was already
  below 0. It was resetting to 0 and then subtracting even when it was
  below 0.

	Added the word "using" after the Download and Upload prompt. This in
  it self should help a great number of people that don't realize you
  should now hit the protocol "hotkey".

	Added a flashing solid white screen during chat request. People have
  ask for this because they are hard of hearing and or have disconnected
  the PC speaker.

	Changing directory code now "retries" once before aborting. This
  should help on networks.

	Status line display of baud rates when running TurboCit under front
  end software or as a sub board now displays the port rate instead of the
  init_baud rate.

	First count of lines of code, total is 28,000+ including header files
  for TurboCit (not BC++ 3.0 headers).

	Increased word length in messages to 512 characters. This might be
  needed to support long lines of ANSI color codes.

	All directory paths are now check twice at startup.

	Added code to filter out messages that only contain ANSI color codes.
  This is added to the code that filters messages with spaces only, or
  lines of space-<CR> space-<CR> over and over.

	Changed the auto ANSI detect a bit. It now requests 3 times, but stops
	requesting as soon as it gets a response.

	TurboCit now reports the number of rooms requested and asked for. It
  also reports the number of messages sent as well. This does not include
  mail.

  Changed .KI to ask all users if they want to view the room description
  file. Before only users with room descriptions turned on were asked.

  Changed the status bar to include a 'R' flag to show "Remote-Sysop"
  status like "Aide" and "Sysop" status.

  Changed the userlog reading code to display a "Remote-Sysop" flag.

  The start time and the estimated time a download will take are now
  shown on the top of the TCit protocol window.

  @ at the room edit menu toggles the Automatic Application flag if the room
  has an application. If this flag is set, the first time a user enters the
  room in a call the application will be called automatically.

  Printer file now actually gets re-opened after shell.

  Removed roomtalley-for-unlogged-user code from startup and terminate, speeds
  things up noticeably.

  New (optional) NODES.CIT keyword- #PREFIX, if present, will be used to dial
  a node instead of the default config.cit #DIAL_PREF

  Net message replies now copy region and country information if present.

  New External.Cit Keyword- #FILEMAIL... Replaces the old "NODE@NODE" code,
  if you define a username as a #FILEMAIL account, any incoming netted messages
  will be written to a file. For example, to duplicate the node@node code, put
  the following line in your external.cit -
  #FILEMAIL "Board Name" "OUTPUT.NET"
  (Replacing Board name with the obvious thing)

  New config.cit keyword, "#PSEUDONYMS", if set to 1 will prompt for a 
  real name after the account name is entered. This field will be stored
  in networking to make connecting to real name only nets easier to interface
  with, but is not displayed in CitNet headers. 

  Exclusive messages are no longer blanked to console when the message is sent 
  to "Sysop", "Aide" or the config.cit #SYSOPNAME

  Modifed the user application code to allow unix wildcards. For example, to 
  set up a login application for everyone, Set up a user application with the
  username as "*" ... To set one up for anyone with the letter X in their
  nym, use the username "*X*" ... This is all case insensitive.

  Reworked the "Copied" messages code so that messages are PHYSICALLY copied
  instead of just having a pointer aimed at them. This makes the code a LOT
  less confusing in that part, and should make the Aide room messages, etc
  work again.

  Killing a message now moves the message to dump and puts a notation in the
  aide room as to the message number killed rather than including a whole 
  'nother copy of the message.

  Inserting a messages now only puts a message in the aide room with the 
  message inserted rather than including a whole 'nother copy of the message.

  Copied messages now net out properly.

  Fixed a minor bug which could put a logging in user in the last hall the 
  previous user was in UNLESS they had a default hall set.

  Fixed a bug in the sysopPage() function which could lock up some machines
  because it specified a negative time to delay.

  .RVU now shows SYSOPS the real name of the users

  Fixed the partial-room code to deal with "start of a room name" at the same
  time as "in the room name", so you'll be able to get to comp.misc even if
  there's a "Misc Blatherings" room, by typing .G misc

  Added the code to do true pointers (instead of 16 calls back), the pointer
  edit menu has changed SIGNIFICANTLY due to this.

  Finished making # of groups configurable in config.cit ... the only caveat
  is you still can't have more than 64 group translation lies in a NODES.CIT
  entry. If you need this to be changed, please tell me.

  Fixed some bugs in the message base configuration code, Where the first 
  message in the base could get munged if it was the last message logically.

  Terminal emulation code is now almost completely implemented. A new termcap
  is forthcoming shortly with emulations for the DEC VT-102 and Wyse 50.
  If you or any of your users has access to information on terminals, please   
  send it to me for inclusion in the database.

  Fixed a problem in the parsing code which had some problems with 3-character
  octal codes and 2-character hex codes.

  Fixed a bug in the netting code which would update pointers at fetch time 
  instead of after incorporation, making it fetch any messages received during
  one network on the next net.

  Added #DOORHOURS keyword to external.cit, see the new external.cit for 
  details.

  F during a message read now posts a "followup" public reply with the same
  subject line and the ability to quote message text.

  T will now read the "Thread" of a message, if it has a subject line, 
  printing only messages with the same subject

  New #TRAP keyword: SHELL, logs cron shell events in the trapfile if present

  If #FLIPCENSOR is set to 2 in config.cit, Read Censored Messages will default
  to on.

  New CONFIG.CIT keywords #QUOTE_OK, #LOGPURGE, #NOCONLOG:
  #QUOTE_OK determines whether message followups will be allowed to quote
  from the message.
  #LOGPURGE is the maximum number of days a user can not call before being
  removed from the user log, regardless of their permanent status. Set this
  to 0 to ignore it.
  You may be surprised the first time you enable this... I set it for 120 days
  (4 months)... And purged almost 2/3 of my userlog. Since the purpose of this
  is to not have to keep zapping permanent users who haven't called in ever and
  ever, I'd set it at a minimum of 6 months, possibly 8... 
  #NOCONLOG, if set to 1, will not trap console actions. This can be useful
  if you're the only person who is logging in on console and you just don't
  CARE what you did.

  Fixed a bug in downloads which could allow screen-pause AFTER the download
  had been started.
