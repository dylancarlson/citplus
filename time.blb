                           2Time/Date Stamp Format0
 
    Time/date stamps may be tailored by each user to their individual
tastes. This is done with the "3T0" command, in the format strings
submenu (350) of the main config menu (3.EC0). The format consists
of plain text, with special format codes to represent untypeable characters
or attributes of the system.  The following are the format codes which can
be used:
 
    Code        Meaning
    %a          Abbreviated weekday name (Sun, Mon, ...).
    %A          Full weekday name (Sunday, Monday, ...).
    %b          Abbreviated month name (Jan, Feb, ...).
    %B          Full month name (January, February, ...).
