    Rooms are areas for messages of a certain topics, with a 30-character
name.  A room may appear in one or more halls.  Sometimes you won't be able
to go to all of the rooms.  This may be because some are in another hall,
or some of them are group-only, or some of them may be hidden.  See about
hidden and group-only rooms below.

   3bG0        -- To go to the next room with unread messages.
   3bB0        -- Skip to next room w/o changing current message pointers.
   3b+0        -- To go to the next room.
   3b-0        -- To go to the previous room.
   3b.Groom0   -- To go to a specific room.
   3b.Broom0   -- Skip to specific room w/o changing current msg pointers.
   3bJ0        -- Jump back to the last room you were in.
 
    To go to a specific room, use the ".Groomname" command.  You can enter a
partial roomname for this command.  ".Groomname" accepts partial roomname
matches.  To avoid ambiguities, it searches forward from the current room.
 
                          3g--- Listing Rooms ---0
 
  3bK0        -- Known rooms - lists all rooms available to you in hall
  3b.KD0      -- Known Directory rooms - lists directory rooms
  3b.KG0      -- Known Group rooms - lists rooms owned by a particular group
  3b.KL0      -- Known Local rooms - lists all rooms not network/shared
  3b.KM0      -- Known Mail rooms - lists rooms in which you have mail
  3b.KN0      -- Known Newrooms only - lists rooms with new messages
  3b.KS0      -- Known Shared rooms - lists networked rooms
  3b.KW0      -- Known Windows - lists rooms which go to other halls
 
                          3g--- Creating Rooms ---0
 
  3b.ER0      -- Enter Room.
  3b.EGR0     -- Enter Group-only (limited access) Room.
 
    These two commands create rooms.  The "Enter Room" command creates a room
that can possibly be accessed by anyone. The "Enter Limited-Access Room"
command may create a room that is limited to the members of a particular
group.  You may only create a group-only room for groups that you are a member
of.  Citadel will prompt you for the name of the group when the room is first
created. You may also create hidden rooms with either of these commands.
Hidden rooms will not be listed in your Known rooms list until you have been
to them. Once you have visited them, they act just like regular rooms.  But
you cannot do this until you have explicitly use the ".G" command to goto
the room, entering its complete roomname.
