Citadel+ is really nothing more than a renamed Gremlin's Citadel. The
name Gremlin's Citadel was mostly as a joke, given when Matt Pfleger did
not expect it to become such a success. While at least Matt and Brent
wanted to rename it simply "Citadel", others objected that it was too
generic, and also a bit conceited to claim to be the One True Citadel.
Thus, the + was added to make it a bit different. Of course, we later
learned that there was already a Citadel Plus. Oh well. Life will always
be confusing.

Citadel+ grew to be the most widely used variant of Citadel before the
development team lost interest and went different ways. The unfinished
version 66 was intended to bridge the gap between dial-up systems and
the Internet: it runs on Win32 (such as Windows 95 and 98 and NT) and
supports multiple simultaneous users connected through either modems or
Telnet. However, it is not complete. It is missing some features, and is
only somewhat stable. Brent and Matt still tinker with 66 at times, and
might even finish it eventually.
