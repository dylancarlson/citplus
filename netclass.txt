To help provide some better labelling of network rooms, a new field has been
implemented in Citadel: NetworkClass.

Each networked room has a NetworkClass. If none has been explicitly defined
for the room, then the default NetworkClass "Unknown" will be used for the
room.

At this time, network classes are defined by one node, The Anticlimactic
Teleservice. Periodically, it will transmit to all other nodes on the
network a NetworkClassList, which lists all NetworkClasses that are
currently in use on the network.

The other nodes then save this data in the file NETINFO.DAT in their
#HOMEPATH.

Also, every time a room is assigned to a NetworkClass on The Anticlimactic
Teleservice, or changed from one NetworkClass to another, it will send a
message to all other nodes on the network notifying them of the change.

If the other nodes have #CHANGENETWORKCLASS set to TRUE in CONFIG.CIT (the
default), then the rooms are changed on them. If, however, this is set to
FALSE, then the remote node will make a note in Aide) if the room is carried
on the local system and it is in some other class.

These messages to other nodes originating on The Anticlimactic Teleservice
will be encrypted. The encryption key will be able to be derived from the
message header, but the method will not be published. This is for security;
I don't like it much either, but there needs to be some control over who
is able to send these messages out.

Once all rooms are assigned to NetworkClasses, you can control which other
nodes get the room by the new NODES.CIT keyword #NOSENDCLASS. You may have
multiple #NOSENDCLASS keywords for each node in the file. You may also
include this in the "Default" node, but this operates a little bit strangely:
if there are any #NOSENDCLASS keywords for a specific node, then they
completly replace the #NOSENDCLASS keywords for the Default node.

Specify which NetworkClasses you don't want to send to the other node. Then
Citadel will neither send the room our, nor will it accept the room from
the other node.

You can also declare which classes you wish to receive from other nodes with
the #REFUSECLASS keyword in NODES.CIT. Set this like #NOSENDCLASS, but include
the NetworkClasses that you do not wish to receive. Then the other node will
not send you messages from rooms in this class (even if you request them in
your ROOMREQ file), and it will not request the rooms from you in its ROOMREQ
file.

You can also declare which classes you wish to receive with the #REQUESTCLASS
keyword. By default, the other node will send you all NetworkClasses that it
has. If you only want one or two NetworkClasses, set #REQUESTCLASS and then
the other node will only send you the classes you request.

Nameing the classes...

The technical side is the easy part. This is the hard part.

Potential NetworkClass names are:

Technical
Network Administration
Discussions
Teen
Recreation

etc.
